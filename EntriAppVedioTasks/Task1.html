    <h3>About the Team</h3>
    <p>The first step is to empathize with the group member who is hesitant to change. Try to understand their reasons, fears, and concerns. Maybe they are worried about losing their status, skills, or relationships. Maybe they are overwhelmed by the uncertainty or complexity of the change. Maybe they have had bad experiences with change in the past. Listen to them without judging or dismissing their feelings. Acknowledge their perspective and validate their emotions.</p>
